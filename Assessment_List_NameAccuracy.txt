| Evaluation Level  | Specific Conditions                                                                                                                                                                                       | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| n/a               | When the search result does not have a Name field in relation to the user's query (e.g., in the case of a pure address result).                                                                           | A result with only an address.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Correct           | When the Name in the search result completely matches the official information for the user's query, with accurate spelling, notation (including proper use of uppercase and lowercase), and punctuation. | "McDonald's" is displayed correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Partially Correct | When the Name in the search result contains minor spelling mistakes, improper usage of uppercase/lowercase letters, or extra/missing words, but overall still indicates the same business or brand.       | For example: "Starbuks" (minor spelling error), or a "Burger King" result that only differs by the presence or absence of "(UK)", or when the query is "Starbucks" but the result is displayed entirely in lowercase "starbucks." |
| Incorrect         | When the Name in the search result is substantially different from the official name for the user's query, showing an incorrect name.                                                                     | For example, when it should be "Coffee Bean" but a completely different name is displayed.                                                                                                                                        |
| Can't Verify      | When there is insufficient official information to determine the accuracy of the Name in the search result in relation to the user's query, making it impossible to verify its correctness.               | When local information is lacking and the name cannot be verified.                                                                                                                                                                |

【Additional Details (Name Accuracy)】  
– In these evaluation criteria, the official business name should be based on the official website or reliable sources, and minor differences in notation (such as uppercase/lowercase, punctuation, symbols) should be considered as "Partially Correct."  
– For brands or chains, the name officially adopted in the local area serves as the standard.  
– Evaluators are required to corroborate the name's accuracy by referring to online searches or official information.
