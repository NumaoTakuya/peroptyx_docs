【3. Address Accuracy (Accuracy of the Address)】  
(Target: To evaluate to what extent the address information in the search result matches the official information in relation to the user's query)

| Evaluation Level               | Specific Conditions                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Examples                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Correct                        | When every element of the address in the search result (street number, building number, street name, sublocality, locality, postal code, country) completely matches the official information for the user's query. | For example, "123 Main St, Springfield, IL 62704, USA" is displayed correctly.                                    |
| Correct with formatting issues | When the content of the address in the search result is correct for the user's query, but there are slight formatting issues (e.g., punctuation, spacing, order, etc.).                                             | For example, "123 Main St,Springfield,IL 62704,USA" (issues with comma or space placement).                       |
| Incorrect                      | When part or all of the address in the search result does not match the official information for the user's query, such as an incorrect street number, street name, or city.                                        | For example, when it should be "123 Main St" but is displayed as "124 Main St."                                   |
| Can't Verify                   | When there is insufficient information to determine the accuracy of the address in the search result for the user's query, or when some address components are missing, making verification impossible.             | For example, when the address is missing a street number or postal code, making it impossible to verify accuracy. |

【Additional Details (Address Accuracy)】  
– In these evaluation criteria, the address should be broken down into components such as "street number," "building number," "street name," "sublocality," "locality," "region or state," "postal code," and "country" for evaluation.  
– If each component matches the official information, or if there are only minor formatting issues (spacing, punctuation, order), it should be judged as "Correct with formatting issues."  
– If some address information is missing, making it difficult to determine correctness, it should be marked as "Can't Verify."
